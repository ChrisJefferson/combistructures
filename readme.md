This code shows some ways we can build automorphism groups, and canonical images, of various kinds of combinatorial structures, using Vole.

This code is currently under development, and will be merged into the 'images', or 'vole', package once it is polished.


test.tst demonstrates how this code can be used, by first building a fundamental structure, then asking for it's automorphism group, or a canonising permutation.
